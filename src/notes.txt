In case of C++ if we want to take the input from the user then we can simply use the getline function.
getline() basically takes the input till it encounters a linebreak.
Arrays are used if we want to store multiple values in a single place. It has a range of memory which is allocated. and it is contiguous.
Each and every index of the array can store an integer. indexes for the array which we are created will start with 0.

if we want to store the array in 2 dimensions the  it is also possible in the similar way the matrices are represented in a program.
The underlying structure of the array in the memory remains the same.
